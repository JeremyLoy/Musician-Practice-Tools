# TODO

- [ ] Split the JS into separate components — dict, tuner, recorder, metronome extracted; drone still needs shared.js
- [ ] Tablet mode: 2-3 column layout, rearrange and hide tools
- [ ] Fullscreen iPhone viewport light doesn't work
- [ ] Audio playback on speakers
- [ ] Resume bug still is an issue

## DONE

- [x] Split the JS into separate components — dictionary extracted into dict.js; tuner extracted into tuner.js
- [x] Extract recorder into recorder.js
- [x] Extract metronome into metronome.js
- [x] Add version to footer
- [x] Tuner is not accurate — replaced NSDF with pitchfinder YIN algorithm
